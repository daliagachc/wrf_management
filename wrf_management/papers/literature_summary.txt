Paper on Lake Titicaca water balance, I used monthly averages of water surface temp. observed during the 2015–2016 period (Table 3) for SST_update files    // Evgeny

    - Gálvez et al., 2005: The WRF model as a tool to understand mesoscale processes on the poorly sampled South American Altiplano (https://ams.confex.com/ams/32Rad11Meso/webprogram/Paper97415.html)
Extended abstract for 11th Conference on Mesoscale Processes (AMS) on modelling Altiplano region with WRF focusing mesoscale circulations and rainfall patterns. I couldn't find any peer-reviewed papers and NOAA's project site seems to be down (http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/pacs/web/ALTIPLANO/NF/). Anyway authors disclosed and fixed revealed boundary condition problems (Lake Titicaca surf. temp.) in default WRF and demonstrated model improvements.
