	abstract = {The ability of the {WRF}-{ARW} (Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research {WRF}) model to forecast extreme rainfall in the Central Andes of Peru is evaluated in this study, using observations from stations located in the Mantaro basin and {GOES} (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) images. The evaluation analyzes the synoptic conditions averaged over 40 extreme event cases, and considers model simulations organized in 4 nested domains. We ﬁrst establish that atypical events in the region are those with more than 27 mm of rainfall per day when averaging over all the stations. More than 50\% of the selected cases occurred during January, February, and April, with the most extreme occurring during February. The average synoptic conditions show negative geopotential anomalies and positive humidity anomalies in 700 and 500 {hPa}. At 200 {hPa}, the subtropical upper ridge or “Bolivian high” was present, with its northern divergent ﬂank over the Mantaro basin. Simulation results show that the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model underestimates rainfall totals in approximately 50–60\% of cases, mainly in the south of the basin and in the extreme west along the mountain range. The analysis of two case studies shows that the underestimation by the model is probably due to three reasons: inability to generate convection in the upstream Amazon during early morning hours, apparently related to processes of larger scales; limitations on describing mesoscale processes that lead to vertical movements capable of producing extreme rainfall; and limitations on the microphysics scheme to generate heavy rainfall.},

	abstract = {Previous studies based on ice cores and sediment samples collected along Andean Ice Caps and the South American Highplane (Altiplano) revealed the development of Paleolake Tauca during the late Pleistocene (15000 - 13000 {BP}). During its maximum expansion, the lake occupied an area of {\textasciitilde}50\% of the Altiplano basin. Motivated by understanding the role of lake-induced circulations on Altiplano climate transitions towards wetter conditions, numerical simulations were made using the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model. In order to do so, combinations of paleolake/no-paleolake and moist/dry atmospheric conditions were analyzed. The results suggest that Paleolake Tauca produced a moister environment in the Altiplano with respect to the present through, enhancing nocturnal mesoscale circulations and rainfall. However, the intensity and distribution of rainfall appears to be modulated by the large-scale moisture field.},

	abstract = {The South American Altiplano has been exposed to prolonged ({\textgreater}1000-year) dry and wet periods in the past according to paleoclimate records. The transitions between these climatic states, however, seem to have occurred rapidly. This study provides a background for understanding the role of mesoscale processes in dry-to-wet transitions by describing lake- and salar-induced circulations and rainfall over the present altiplano from special observations. These include special networks of pilot balloon and daily rainfall observations collected in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca and the Salar de Uyuni during the rainy season of 2002-3, as part of the South American Low Level Jet Experiment ({SALLJEX}). Rainfall observations indicate that nocturnal convection over Lake Titicaca is nearly double the rainfall amounts over the surrounding altiplano with values that exceed 200 mm mo-1. Over the Salar de Uyuni, however, convective clouds are largely absent according to satellite observations. Daytime onshore flow and associated low-level divergence were observed over both Lake Titicaca and the Salar de Uyuni, with comparable magnitudes but larger values over the latter. Nocturnal offshore flow and associated low-level convergence were present over the lake but not over the salar, where the divergence values neared zero by sunrise. The arrival of flow from gaps in the surrounding mountain ranges, present near both features, produces rainfall only over the lake. The lack salar-induced nocturnal convergence and high boundary layer moisture content seem to be the factors that suppress the generation of rainfall over the salar.},

@article{galvez_modulation_2006,

	abstract = {Rainfall over Lake Titicaca occurs in the form of nocturnal lake-induced convective storms. They represent {\textasciitilde}55\% of the lake’s water input and therefore have implications in climate and paleoclimate scales. This study uses the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model to investigate the role of the lake in the modulation of these storms. The goals are to improve regional weather and climate forecasts and to provide information about the role of lakes on dryto-wet transitions in the altiplano. The results point to low-level convergence and moisture as essential for the development and maintenance of the storms. The mid-tropospheric flow also seems to play an important role in their enhancement or suppression based on the interaction with local circulations induced by orography. Weak southeasterly flow favors storm development. Strong flow, especially from the northeast, suppresses storm development by shifting the region of low-level convergence away from the source of heat and moisture.},
